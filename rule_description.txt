Every character, weapon and room is represented by a special card in the game. Before the game
starts one character, one weapon and one room card are selected at random and placed in a special
envelope. This is then located in the center of the board. These cards represent the “solution” — that
is, they identify the murderer, the murder weapon and murder room. The remaining weapon, room
and character cards are then dealt evenly to the players.

Players take it in turns to roll the dice and move their character token a corresponding number of
squares. When a player enters a room he/she can announce a suggestion which consists of that room,
and a character and weapon (if necessary, the character and weapon pieces are moved into the room).
By making the announcement, the player is hypothesising that these solve the murder.

When an announcement is made, each player responds in a clock-wise fashion until either: the
suggestion is refuted; or, all players have indicated they cannot refute the suggestion. A suggestion
is refuted by a player if that player contains a matching card. In other words, the player contains a
card and, hence, that card cannot be in the solution envelope.

Play continues until a player believes he/she has determined the solution. At that point, he/she
makes an accusation consisting of a weapon, character and room (note: unlike suggestions, the player
does not need to be in a room to make an accusation involving it). The accusation is then checked
by the player against the solution. If it is correct the player wins, otherwise the player is eliminated
from the game.
